# Variance Workflow Overview

This document explains the current end‑to‑end pipeline for ingesting textual
versions, preparing pagination metadata, running Medite, and injecting page
markers into comparison outputs.

---

## 1. Version Upload

1. **User action**  
   Upload a `.txt` version via the UI (`versions` card → “Téléverser une
   version”).

2. **Validation** (`VersionController::store`)  
   - File must be plain text (`text/plain`).  
   - File size limited to 8 MB (`max:8192` in kilobytes).

3. **Storage**
   - Raw upload stored at `storage/app/public/uploads/versions/{base}.txt`.  
   - The controller converts the contents to UTF‑8, normalises whitespace, and
     wraps the text in a TEI skeleton with `<lb/>` markers for every original
     line.  
   - The TEI document is saved to `storage/app/public/uploads/versions/{base}.xml`
     and mirrored to the public tree (`public/uploads/versions/{base}.xml`) for
     the legacy PHP frontend.

4. **Database**  
   A `versions` row is created with the generated folder name (`{sequence}{shortTitle}`).

---

## 2. `_lignes` Upload & Sidecar Generation

1. **User action**  
   Upload the `_lignes` file for a given version (`versions` card → “Importer
   un fichier _lignes”).

2. **Storage**  
   The raw `_lignes` text is copied to `storage/app/private/lignes/{version_id}.txt`.

3. **Sidecar job** (`ApplyLignesJob`)  
   - Dispatched automatically; reads the `_lignes` file, parses each page entry,
     and matches it against the TEI version.  
   - No HTML is modified. Instead, the job produces a sidecar JSON file with
     character offsets for each marker:
     `storage/app/private/pagination/{version_id}.json`.
   - Sidecar metadata includes `marker_count`, `missed_count`, canonical text
     hash, and per‑marker context snippets.

4. **Progress tracking**  
   Version‑level progress is written to `storage/app/tmp/pager/{version_id}.json`
   so the UI can display “sidecar ready” once the job completes.

---

## 3. Facsimile Upload & Manifest Management

1. **User action**  
   Upload facsimile batches from the Versions card or use the manifest manager in the facsimile carousel to curate existing images.

2. **Processing**  
   `FacsimileController` dispatches `ProcessFacsimileImage` jobs on the `facsimiles` queue. Each job normalises filenames (`img_*` convention), generates thumbnails, and stores the assets under `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/{version}`.

3. **Manifest curation**  
   The facsimile blade lists all comparisons for the selected version via `/api/versions/{version}/comparisons`. Saving a selection (`PUT /api/versions/{version}/manifests/{comparison}`) writes `images_{role}_{author--work--comparison}.json` alongside the images and updates the “JSON” badge in the comparisons table. If no curated manifest exists when publishing, Laravel generates one that includes all images.

4. **Events**  
   Successive uploads/fire-and-save actions emit `facsimilesUploaded` and `comparisonManifestUpdated` browser events so the gallery and comparisons table stay in sync without a reload.

5. **Cancel upload / rollback**  
   During long facsimile folder uploads, the modal exposes an explicit cancel action. Cancelling aborts the current HTTP batch, removes partial files and queued items, and restores the previous facsimile series when a backup exists (`DELETE /api/versions/{version}/facsimiles/cancel-upload?restore_previous=1`).

## 4. Running Medite

1. **User action**  
   Launch a comparison from the comparisons card (`Lancer Medite`).

2. **Medite controller** (`MediteController::runMedite`)  
   - Collects the source/target TEI files and run parameters.  
   - Calls the Flask service (`medite` container) which runs the Celery task
     `run_diff_script`.

3. **Medite output**  
   - TEI diff and XHTML components (`source.xhtml`, `target.xhtml`, `d.xhtml`,
     `i.xhtml`, `r.xhtml`, `s.xhtml`) generated under
     `/app/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{comparison_id}` (container path).
   - Files are mirrored back to Laravel’s storage:
     `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{comparison_id}`.
   - Public copies are optionally created when publishing.

4. **Database**  
   A `comparisons` row is inserted/updated with the chosen parameters and the
   generated folder name (e.g. `{source}-{target}-runN`).

---

## 5. Injecting Pagination Markers into Comparisons

1. **User action**  
   Click “Injecter la pagination” on a comparison row.

2. **Controller** (`ComparisonController::applyPageMarkers`)  
   - Verifies that both versions have a pagination sidecar.  
   - Marks the comparison as queued (`PageMarkerService::markComparisonQueued`).  
   - Dispatches `InjectComparisonPaginationJob`.

3. **Job behaviour**
   - For each role (`source`, `target`):
     - Loads `storage/app/private/pagination/{version_id}.json`.  
     - Reads the current XHTML (`source.xhtml` / `target.xhtml`) from the
       comparison directory.  
     - Injects `<span class="page-marker">` nodes at the recorded character
       offsets (optionally clearing/replacing existing markers).  
     - Writes the updated XHTML back to both storage and mirror locations.
   - Comparison‑scoped progress is written to
     `storage/app/tmp/pager/comparisons/{comparison_id}.json`. The front‑end
     polls this file to display per‑role status (queued → running → done).

---

## 6. Downloading the Legacy Bundle

The comparisons table exposes an “Exporter le pack legacy” button. Clicking it
does not open a blocking download tab anymore. Instead, the UI calls
`POST /comparisons/{comparison}/export` and Laravel queues a background job on
the `exports` queue.

While the zip is being prepared, the comparison row shows a spinner state and
polls `GET /comparisons/{comparison}/export/status`. Once the snapshot reaches
`ready`, the export action turns into a direct download link pointing to
`GET /comparisons/{comparison}/export/download`.

The prepared archive bundles:

- The published comparison directory (`public/uploads/{author}/{work}/{comparison_folder}`).
- For each role, only the facsimile images referenced in the active manifest JSON, plus the manifest file itself.

For `dev` publications, the exporter uses the comparison draft directory
(`storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{id}`) while still
packaging it with the published comparison folder name inside the zip.

This produces a zip matching the legacy Variance folder layout without shipping
unused images.

## 7. Publication (prod/dev)

Comparisons are **unpublished by default**. The admin toggles “Publier” and
selects a scope (`prod` or `dev`):

- **prod**: copies the comparison components to
  `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/{folder}` and mirrors them to
  `variance/uploads/{author}/{work}/{folder}` for the legacy site.  
- **dev**: keeps the components in the comparison draft directory
  `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{id}` and mirrors that
  folder to `variance/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{id}` so `/dev` can
  read them.

On publish, Laravel also:
  - Ensures facsimiles are copied into the legacy tree.
  - Writes/refreshes the manifest JSON for the comparison.
  - Optionally inserts a single default page marker if the admin requests it.

---

## Background Jobs & Workers

- All pagination work (`ApplyLignesJob`, `InjectComparisonPaginationJob`) runs on
  the `page-markers` queue.  
- Legacy bundle preparation (`GenerateLegacyExportJob`) runs on the `exports`
  queue.
- The default Docker setup includes a `laravel-queue` service that runs  
  `php artisan queue:work --queue=facsimiles,page-markers,exports`.  
- Developers can also run `docker compose exec laravel php artisan queue:work
  --queue=page-markers,exports` to process jobs manually.
- Facsimile uploads trigger `ProcessFacsimileImage` jobs on the `facsimiles` queue; keep the worker running to see gallery updates.

## Summary of Key Paths

| Artifact                         | Location                                                          |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uploaded TXT                    | `storage/app/public/uploads/versions/{folder}.txt`                |
| Generated TEI                   | `storage/app/public/uploads/versions/{folder}.xml`                |
| `_lignes` raw file              | `storage/app/private/lignes/{version_id}.txt`                     |
| Pagination sidecar JSON         | `storage/app/private/pagination/{version_id}.json`                |
| Facsimile manifest JSON         | `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/{version}/images_{role}_{author--work--comparison}.json` |
| Version progress                | `storage/app/tmp/pager/{version_id}.json`                         |
| Comparison progress             | `storage/app/tmp/pager/comparisons/{comparison_id}.json`          |
| Comparison XHTML/TEI            | `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{id}`     |
| Published comparison (prod)     | `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/{comparison_folder}` + mirror in `variance/uploads/...` |
| Published comparison (dev)      | `storage/app/public/uploads/{author}/{work}/comparisons/{id}` + mirror in `variance/uploads/.../comparisons/{id}` |
| Export status snapshot          | `storage/app/private/exports/comparisons/{comparison_id}.json`    |
| Exported legacy zip             | `storage/app/private/exports/comparisons/{comparison_id}/{comparison_folder}_legacy.zip` |

This flow keeps the canonical TEI untouched, stores pagination metadata as a
sidecar, and applies markers to comparisons on demand so every run stays
reproducible and auditable.
