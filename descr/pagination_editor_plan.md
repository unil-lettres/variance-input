# Pagination Editor & Sidecar Alignment

This note captures the work needed to align the in-app CodeMirror editor with the canonical pagination flow (TEI `<pb>` markers → `_lignes` sidecar → `<span class="page-marker">…` injection). The goal: editors insert semantic `<pb>` tags inside versions, Medite keeps them in every comparison, and the pagination jobs still control display-level markers.

## Current situation

- The CodeMirror toolbar inserts full `<span class="page-marker" …>` blocks (see `resources/js/codemirror-editor.js:~570`). Those spans are meant for XHTML comparisons, not TEI sources.
- Variance versions are uploaded as `.txt` → wrapped into TEI via `VersionController::store`. Only a small whitelist of inline tags survive; we recently reintroduced `<pb>` to keep pagination hints from TXT fixtures.
- Medite reads the TEI files referenced by a version folder (via `MediteController::convertPath`). Any inline `<span class="page-marker">…` markup gets copied to the comparison, but that markup is brittle (role-specific orientation, icon path, data-image-name padding) and bypasses the `_lignes` sidecar.
- The downstream pagination job (`InjectComparisonPaginationJob` / `PageMarkerService::insertComparisonMarkers`) expects to own `<span class="page-marker">` blocks. It clears/replaces them per comparison and ensures orientation matches source/target roles.

## Desired behaviour

1. **Editing** – The CodeMirror editor should seed semantic placeholders (`<pb facs="…" pagination="…"/>`) rather than the final `<span>` block.
2. **Persistence** – `VersionController::store` already whitelists `<pb>` so uploads and inline edits keep those nodes intact.
3. **Sidecar compatibility** – `_lignes` parsing / pagination JSON stays the single source of truth for offsets, letting the job inject `<span class="page-marker">…` blocks into comparisons (and eventually swap or remove them) without relying on editors crafting perfect HTML.

## Implementation plan

### 1. Editor changes (frontend)
- [ ] Update `resources/js/codemirror-editor.js`
  - Replace `insertPageMarker()` payload with `<pb facs="…" pagination="…"/>`.
  - Adjust regexes/cache builders (search for existing markers, highlight logic, counters) to detect `<pb>` instead of `<span class="page-marker">`.
  - Ensure orientation-specific icon names are no longer referenced; if needed, capture target/source orientation as data attributes to help editors pick pagination codes.
  - Update error messages/tooltips to mention “balise `<pb>`” insertion.
- [ ] Adapt the editor Blade (`resources/views/components/main/editor/version.blade.php`)
  - Revise any contextual help text describing page markers.
  - Consider adding a short cheat sheet (e.g., valid attributes: `facs`, `pagination`, optional `corresp`) so editors know what the CodeMirror button will inject.
- [ ] Rebuild assets (`npm run build`) once changes land.

### 2. Backend readiness
- [x] `VersionController::store` now preserves `<pb>` tags (already merged).
- [ ] Confirm `EditorController::versionUpdate` doesn’t sanitize away self-closing tags. If we add validation, ensure the regex accepts `<pb …/>`.
- [ ] (Optional) extend `PageMarkerService::countMarkersInVersion` to report `<pb>` counts as an early validation signal in the UI.

### 3. Sidecar alignment
- [ ] Document that `_lignes` remains the canonical input for pagination dispatch.
- [ ] (Optional stretch) add a console command or queue job that scans TEI `<pb>` markers and produces a draft `_lignes` file, so editors can bootstrap sidecars from inline hints.
- [ ] Verify that `InjectComparisonPaginationJob` behaves identically when comparisons already contain `<pb>` nodes (no change expected).

### 4. QA & rollout
- [ ] Unit-level sanity: add/update tests under `medite/app/variance/tests` to confirm `xml2medite` + `medite2xml` keep `<pb>` nodes round-trippable.
- [ ] Manual workflow test:
  1. Insert `<pb>` tags via CodeMirror in a test version.
  2. Run a comparison; confirm the resulting TEI/XHTML show the markers as verbatim `<pb>`.
  3. Upload `_lignes`, run pagination injection, and confirm `<span class="page-marker">` replaces the expected spots.
- [ ] Update `README.md` / `descr/workflow.md` to describe the new editing flow and the rationale (semantic markers in versions, visual markers injected later).

### 5. Communication & migration
- [ ] Prepare a short in-app notice or admin email explaining that the version editor now inserts `<pb>` tags; editors should re-run pagination injection to keep comparisons in sync.
- [ ] Audit existing versions that may already contain `<span class="page-marker">` blocks and consider stripping them (scripted cleanup) so the new workflow is consistent.

Each checkbox can become a ticket/task for the upcoming sprint. The biggest lift is the CodeMirror refactor plus UX messaging; backend pieces mostly stay as-is thanks to the recent `<pb>` whitelist update.

1. **Editor update**
   - Change `insertPageMarker` in `resources/js/codemirror-editor.js` to emit `<pb …/>` tags, probably with attributes `facs` (image code) and `pagination` (page label). Optionally infer orientation so editors know which suffix (e.g. `S‑1r`) to type.
   - Adapt helper routines (marker cache, highlighting, search) to match `<pb …/>` patterns instead of `<span class="page-marker">…`. Most logic only needs regex tweaks.
   - Update the UI hints/tooltips so editors understand they are inserting TEI markers, not final page widgets.

2. **TEI lifecycle**
   - Ensure the version editor writes back UTF‑8 TEI unchanged (already handled by `EditorController::versionUpdate`). No extra work unless we want validation (e.g., reject malformed `<pb>` tags).
   - On upload, expand the whitelist if we decide to support additional inline pagination hints (e.g., future `<milestone>`).

3. **Sidecar / pagination job**
   - No logic change: `_lignes` → JSON → `PageMarkerService::insertComparisonMarkers` should remain authoritative for producing `<span class="page-marker">…` blocks.
   - Optional enhancement: expose a “prefill `_lignes` from `<pb>`” tool so editors don’t have to maintain both; this can read `<pb>` nodes, map them to `{image,page,phrase}`, and create a draft `_lignes` file for review.

4. **Verification**
   - Regression tests: run Medite on a version containing `<pb>` markers to ensure they appear in TEI diff (`*.xml`) and raw XHTML outputs prior to pagination injection.
   - After injection, confirm `<span class="page-marker">` blocks match the sidecar regardless of any inline `<pb>` tags already present.

Deliverable: editor inserts `<pb>` tags, the pagination jobs still manage the display spans, and users can generate unlimited comparisons knowing their manual pagination hints survive upstream.
